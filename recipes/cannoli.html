    <h4>A cannoli is a tube-shaped Italian dessert that consists of fried 
        pastry dough stuffed with a sweet, creamy cheese filling.</h4>
    <p>Cannoli are Sicilian pastries consisting of fried, tube-shaped shells filled with a sweet, creamy filling, 
        traditionally made with ricotta cheese. The shells are typically made from a dough containing 
        flour, cocoa, coffee, sugar, and butter. The filling is often flavored with sugar, vanilla, and sometimes chocolate 
        or other additions. Cannoli are a popular dessert, particularly during the holidays, and are known for their crispy 
        shell and creamy filling. </p>
