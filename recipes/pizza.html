    <h4>This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. 
        You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.</h4>
    <p>Pizza is an Italian, specifically Neapolitan, dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped 
        with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
